# Platform API
---

Platform API consists of two APIs:
 - **Agent API** - for handling chats on behalf of agents
 - **Customer API** - for handling chats on behalf of customers

Both APIs have much in common. Request/response format and success/error handling are similar and are described in this reference:

 - [Protocol](./protocol)
 - [Success and error handling](./success-error)

# Platform API
---

Platform API consists of two APIs:

 - **Agent API** - for handling chats on behalf of agents
 - **Customer API** - for handling chats on behalf of customers

Both APIs have much in common. Request/response format and success/error handling are similar and are described in this reference:

 - [Protocol](./protocol)
 - [Success and error handling](./success-error)

Here is some example of simple chat flow. From logging in, through starting chat to sending events:

<video loop width="750" height="500" controls>
<source type="video/mp4" src="./getting-started/images/simple_event_schema.mp4">
</video>

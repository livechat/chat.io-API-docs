# Chat and thread


### Basics

In our system each chat is divided into threads. Threads are standalone parts of a chat and can contain events. Multiple users (customers or agents) can participate in a chat and every user can have multiple chats at the same time.

New threads within a chat are created on the server side, algorithm of this is discussed below in [Advanced](#advanced) section.

Events are portions of data which can be sent to a chat (e.g. in messages). See the next section of this guide for details (coming soon).

### Getting chats

If you log in to the Agent or Customer API you will receive one of the following in login response: chats_summary or last_chats_summary. Both of these objects contain some chat and thread IDs and these can be used to retrieve the chat history.

Depending on whether you are a Customer or an Agent, you have to use different methods to retrieve your chat history.

**Agent methods**:

 - [get_archives](../../agent-api/client-server#get-archives)
 - [get_filtered_chats](../../agent-api/client-server#get-filtered-chats)
 - [get_chat_threads](../../agent-api/client-server#get-chat-threads)

**Customer methods**:

 - [get_chats_summary](../../customer-api/client-server#get-chats-summary)
 - [get_chat_threads](../../customer-api/client-server#get-chat-threads)
 - [get_chat_threads_summary](../../customer-api/client-server#get-chat-threads-summary)

### Chatting

You can start a chat via the [start_chat](../../agent-api/client-server#start-chat) method both on the Customer and Agent side. If you are an agent you can also [join](../../agent-api/client-server#join-chat) a chat or [supervise](../../agent-api/client-server#supervise-chat) it. When you are in a chat you can send events to it via [send_event](../../agent-api/client-server#send-event) method.

Currently all new events and chats are sent to all agents within the license. In the future *scopes* will define which groups of users have access to chats/events and other types of data. (currently scopes are used for something different and will be documented in this guide soon)

### Pushes

 If a chat or a thread is created or closed when you're logged in, we will send you server push messages (in both APIs):

 - [incoming_chat_thread](../../agent-api/server-client#incoming-chat-thread)
 - [thread_closed](../../agent-api/server-client#thread-closed)
 - [chat_users_updated](../../agent-api/server-client#chat-users-updated)


### Advanced

The following rules apply:

 - one thread within chat can be an *active thread* - if you send events to the chat your events will be added to this thread, it can be only last thread
 - chats are not continous, there can be empty (time) spaces between threads
 - if there is no active thread in a chat (e.g. the last active thread has been closed), sending event to that chat will start a new thread (annotation event is exception here, it will be added in the end of last thread)
 - when a new chat is started (via [start_chat](../../agent-api/client-server#start-chat)), a new thread is created within that chat
 - the algorithm which decides how the chats are distributed between the agents is called routing and will be documented in this guide in the Routing section

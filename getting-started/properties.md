# Properties

Properties are key - value storage whithin some object, like chat or agent. Currently there are properties of chat, thread, event and customer. They can be splitted to two groups:

 - [configurable properties](#configurable-properties) (chat, thread, event)
 - [custom properties](#custom-properties) (customer)

 
### Configurable properites

Configurable properties have predefined keys, and types of values. Currently configuration is hardcoded for chat.io product purpose, but it will be available soon, to create your own configuration.

Properties are splitted into groups on 2 levels: license and namespace.


### Configuration

Every property can have variety of things configured like value type, value domain and locations (chat, thread and event). It can also have behaviours set (in ex. pass_from_chat_to_active_thread).

### chat.io product properties

### Custom properties

Custom properties can be set only within customer, and they can hold values of any type for any key. This type of properties is temporary and will be removed in future versions.
